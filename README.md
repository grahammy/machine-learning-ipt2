Introduction to Machine Learning

What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning this is the subset of AI which is mainly concerned with extraction of knowledge from data. Through which the machine is trained through data feeding so as so to create experience and enhance it to reason when provided with new data. For the current time the application of ML is found in various fields such as commercial application, automatic recommendation in various powerful websites such Facebook and Netflix.

Types of Machine Learning.

There three main types of Machine Learning which are:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

Why Machine Learning?

Because manually crafting decisions is feasible for some application particularly those which have good understanding of the process to model. Example of the area in which handcoded rules fails is on the detection of faces in images.

However, using machine learning by presenting a program with a large collection of data of a specific domain is enough for an algorithm to determine what characteristics are needed to identify a given domain.

Problems Machine Learning Can Solve

Machine Learning in recent areas has a tremendous influence in various areas mainly serving various problem such problems include the following Medical Diagnosis such determining whether a tumor is benign or malignant, Detection of fraudulent activity in credit card transaction, Segmenting customers into groups with similar preference since using the approach of mass marketing it leads to poor revenue, Detecting abnormal access patterns to website other problems solved by machine learning include speech recognition, Anomaly and event detection and Computational biology.

Knowing The Data

As machine learning is mainly concerned with data knowing the data used in a specific task is of great consideration by understanding on how it relates with task addressed. Some of the basic question when dealing with data are:

- What is question(s) trying to answer?
- Is the data collected enough to represent the problem to be solved?
- What features of the data to extract and will they enable the right prediction?

Why Python Preferred What Other Languages?

Python is used in machine learning due to the following reasons:

- Python is full of data science libraries such as data loading(pandas), visualization(matplotlib) and statistics(numpy) it also has machine learning framework such as Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras.
- Ability to direct interact with the code using terminal or tool like jupyter notebook.
- Python is easy to understand since it is mainly semantic also it has a supportive community

Other languages that can be used in machine learning are R, Julia and Scala.

What are function of Python Libraries and Jupyter Notebook?

- Scikit-learn this is the python library which mainly comprises a number of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
- Numpy this is the python library that is mainly concerned with scientific computing.
- Scipy library is a collection of functions for scientific computing.
- Matplotlib is the primary scientific plotting library in python.
- Pandas is a python library for data wrangling and analysis.

Jupyter Notebook this is an interactive environment for running code in the browser.

Python 2 OR Python 3?

Python 2 and Python 3 are just versions of Python, Python 2 being the older version and Python 3 being the latest version and mostly preferred since it contains major changes.
